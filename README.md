# california-housing-price-prediction

## Project Overview

For a complete overview of the project, see [CALIFORNIA_HOUSING_PRICE_PREDICTION_README.pdf](./CALIFORNIA_HOUSING_PRICE_PREDICTION_README.pdf).

## How to Run

The complete training and evaluation process is implemented in the Colab notebook: [housing_price_prediction.ipynb](./notebooks/housing_price_prediction.ipynb).

To reproduce results:

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Update any Drive paths in the early code cells if your setup differs.
3. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the model.
